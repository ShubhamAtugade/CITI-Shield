Crimes against vulnerable populations, such as children and senior citizens, remain a critical issue, highlighting the need for better protection mechanisms. At the same time, a substantial portion of crimes remains unreported due to social stigma, lack of trust in the police, or fear of repercussions, which makes addressing the actual crime rate even more challenging.")

It encompasses crime statistics from 19 metropolitan cities over the years 2014 to 2021. This application enables predictions of crime rates across ten distinct categories, which include murder, kidnapping, crimes against women, crimes against children, juvenile offenses, crimes against senior citizens, crimes targeting Scheduled Castes (SC), crimes against Scheduled Tribes (ST), economic offenses, and cybercrimes.")

The model functions by constructing multiple decision trees, each contributing to the prediction for the target variable. The final output is computed by averaging these individual predictions, resulting in enhanced accuracy compared to a single decision tree methodology. Notably, the model has attained an accuracy rate of 93.20% on the testing dataset when forecasting crime rates.")
